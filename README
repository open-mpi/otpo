What is OTPO?  

OTPO (Open Tool for Parameter Optimizations) is an Open MPI specific
tool that is meant to explore the MCA parameter space. In Open MPI,
the user can specify at runtime many values for MCA parameters
(ompi_info param all all). The parameters include the OpenIB BTL
parameters (ompi_info param btl openib). OTPO is a tool that takes in
a list of any MCA parameters, with a user specified range of values
for those parameters, and for every combination of the MCA parameter
values, OTPO executes an MPI job, measuring latency (the only
measurement available right now), bandwidth, etc.. The tests used for
the measurements are modular. Right now, only Netpipe test is
available. OTPO outputs a list of the best parameter combinations for
a certain test.

The main purpose of OTPO is to explore the effect of the MCA
parameters on different machines with different architectures and
configurations, and explore the dependencies between the MCA
parameters themselves. OTPO is meant to run on the head node of a
cluster, and it forks MPI jobs after exporting the current combination
of MCA parameters on the nodes.

OTPO is built on top of ADCL [1] (Abstract Data and Communication
Library). ADCL is an application level communication library aiming at
providing the highest possible performance for application level
communication operations in a given execution environment. OTPO uses
ADCL to provide the runtime selection logic and choosing the best
combination of parameters.

How to run OTPO?

OTPO includes an ADCL copy, but if the user has another ADCL copy on
his machine, he/she can set the ADCL directory on configure.  The
first thing the user needs to specify is the file containing the
parameters. Basically the file contains the name of the parameter and
the following options for each parameter:

-d default value

Option to set the possible values manually:
-p {possible_values}: option for the user to explicitly list the
 possible values for the parameter

OR to specify a range with an increment by an operation with a specific RPN:
-r start_value end_value: specify the start and end value for the
 parameter
-t traversal_method arguments: The method to traverse the range of
 variables for the parameter. increment method is only available now,
 which takes arguments the operation and the operator.
-i rpn: RPN condition that the parameter combinations must satisfy.

A sample file (OpenIB_Parameters) is included for convenience. However
note that the MCA parameter space for Open-MPI is always changing, so
some parameters might be invalid or the values might not make
sense. This is just to help with showing how the format of the input
file is.

Next the user needs to have a benchmark compiled and ready to run
somewhere. Currently OTPO supports 3 benchmarks: 
- Netpipe 
- Skampi (5.0.1 is required for otpo to work with skampi). 
- NPB

However it's not hard to write a plugin for another benchmark, since
the design is modular.

After specifying the list of parameters, the user is ready to run
OTPO. The usage options for running OTPO are:

Required:
-p InputFileName (file that contains the parameters)
-t test (name of test, Current supported: Netpipe NPB Skampi)
-w test_path (path to the test on your system and the executable. 
   Example: -w /home/user1/Netpipe/NPmpi)

Optional:
-d (debug output)
-v (verbose output)
-s (status output)
-n (silent/no output)
-l message_length (default is 1 byte)
-h hostfile
-m mca_params (mca parameters that you want set when running with OMPI. 
   Note that those are not the parameters that you want to tune. Those are 
   parameters that you want when runnning all the tests)
-f format (format of output, TXT)
-o output_dir (directory where the results will be placed, default: results)
-b interrupt_file (file to write intermediate data when interrupted, 
   default: interrupt.txt)
-r interrupt_file (the file which contains the data to resume execution) 
-c Collective operation number (if using Skampi)
   0- Bcast, 
   1- Barrier, 
   2- Reduce, 
   3- Allreduce, 
   4- Gather, 
   5- Allgather, 
   6- Gatherv, 
   7-  Allgatherv, 
   8- Alltoall, 
   9- Alltoallv, 
   10- Scatter, 
   11- Scatterv)
-a Number of processes (if using Skampi)
-e Operation for Reduce/Allreduce like MPI_MAX
-x generate an input file from an ouput result file

A sample run command would be:

 ./otpo -p OpenIB_Parameters -t Netpipe -w path_to_where_netpipe_is_compiled/NPmpi

The --generate_input_file (-x) option is a feature that allows a user
to give OTPO previously generated result files. OTPO would then use
these files to parse the parameters and the values noted as the best
values for those parameters and generate a new input parameter file
from them automatically. This can be done using UNION or INTERSECTION
of the files, which should be specified with the operation parameter
-e or --operations.
An example to run this feature on three result file (R1 R2 and R3):
./otpo -x R1 R2 R3 -e union -o union_input_file
./otpo -x R1 R2 R3 -e intersection -o intersection_input_file

NOTE to users that using skampi to tune parameters in the COLL
Hierarch Module works only with OMPI trunk and 1.5 and above. As for
the COLL tuned module, currently it works in OMPI version where the
use_dynamic_rules mca parameter works correctly. The latest release of
OMPI (1.4) does not have that working, so OTPO would not work if the
user is trying to tune COLL_Tuned mca parameters. The main idea is
that OTPO works if OMPI works :-)

What are the results?

The results are placed in a sub-directory. Every single run of OTPO
produces a file with a time stamp that contains the best attribute
combinations. It gives the best combination around the best value that
it found. These results files produced by OTPO are meant to be
intermediate results to an analysis tool in OTPO that takes in any
number of result files, does some sort of analysis, and gives the
final analysis to the user. The analysis option in OTPO is still under
development and research.

OTPO and ADCL:

We mentioned earlier that OTPO is built on top of ADCL. We have to
note that ADCL is an MPI application, but we are not interested in the
parts of ADCL where MPI is needed. So we created a dummy MPI library
within ADCL that the user can use instead of the real MPI library
(option set on configure). The other reason for the dummy MPI library
is the fact that MPI and fork cause badness in the
application. Another options in ADCL that need to be set on configure
are the user level timings and number of tests. In short, if the user
is using his own ADCL version, he must have the following configure
options:

--enable-printf-tofile 
--with-num-tests=1 
--enable-userlevel-timings 
--enable-dummy-mpi

How is OTPO implemented?

In OTPO we have a global structure array that contains all the
parameters and their characteristics. Here are the attributes of each
parameter in the general structure:

    char *name; /* name of the parameter */
    char *string_values[MAX_VALUES]; /* possible values in strings */
    char *default_value; /* default value for the parameter */
    int     *possible_values; /* possible values for the parameter */
    int     num_values; /* number of values possible for that parameter */
    int      start_value; /* start value (in case of range) */
    int      end_value; /* end value (in case of range) */
    enum otpo_traverse_method  traverse; /* traversal method of the possible attribute values (in case of range) */
    enum otpo_operator  operation; /* operation on how to apply the increment */
    char condition[CONDITION_LENGTH]; /* rpn condition that the parameter has to satisfy */
    otpo_rpn_stack_element rpn_elements[RPN_MAX_ELEMENTS]; /* stack that holds all the rpn elements */
    int  num_rpn_elements;
    unsigned int  otpo_flags; /* virtual - aggregate etc. */
    /* The following is a union with one variable, because later, other traversal methods might be added */
    union traverse_attr_t /* attributes to the traversal method */
    {
        int increment;
    }traverse_attr;

The first step is to parse the input file and populate this array of parameters. 

Next we need to create the ADCL objects (details of each object are
specified in the ADCL documentation):

- ADCL_Attribute [num_parameters]: abstraction for the characterstics of an attribute
- ADCL_Attrset: A group of ADCL attributes
- ADCL_Function [num_combinations]: equivalent to a combination of attribute values
- ADCL_Fnctset: Group of functions
- ADCL_Request: a handle to start each test and update the results

Creating the ADCL_Function requires us to attach the function pointer
to the test function that we want. In our case all the function
pointers are the same, and point to the function where we get the
current combination and execute the test.  When the ADCL_Request is
created, we execute ADCL_Request_start for the number of combinations
that we have. Basically this calls the test function that is
associated with the functions (combinations).

The test function in OTPO does the following:
- Fork
- Child:
  o asks ADCL to return the attributes and the values for the current combination
  o exports the environment variables for each attribute
  o exec mpirun with the specified test path at runtime
- Parent:
  o waits for the child to complete
  o if more than TIMEOUT pass, it will terminate the child and updates ADCL with a “bad values”, i.e. large value for latency.
  o when child completes, it gathers the results (reads from np.out in case of Netpipe) and updates the ADCL request.

Finally OTPO writes the results to a file with a time stamp.

More work?

OTPO still misses the analysis portion. It generates the results, but
those results need to be interpreted and given to the user in a nicely
formatted way. This is a challenge due to the fact that the result
files may be very large, and may not have the same attributes.
